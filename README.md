# Nida's Birthday Game Arcade

This project is a small collection of mini-games written in plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Open `index.html` in any modern browser to play.

The CSS and JavaScript code live in `style.css` and `script.js` for easier maintenance.
## Games
- **Elemental Bending Practice** – drag elemental symbols to their quadrants.
- **Sunflower Bloom** – plant seeds by tapping to grow a garden.
- **Cabbage Cart Chaos** – help the cabbage merchant deliver his cabbages.
- **Spirit World Path** – draw lines to connect spirit nodes in sequence.
- **Appa's Sky Journey** – dodge obstacles and collect sky biscuits.

## Running
Simply clone the repository or download the files and open `index.html` in your browser. No build step is required. The page uses Tailwind CDN for styling.

Enjoy and feel free to customise or extend the games!
